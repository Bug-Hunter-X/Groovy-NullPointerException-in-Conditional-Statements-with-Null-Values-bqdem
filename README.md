This example demonstrates a common Groovy pitfall involving null values in conditional expressions.  The `myMethod` function intends to return the larger of two numbers. However, when one of the inputs is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown because Groovy's default behavior is to not handle null values gracefully in comparisons. This can be especially problematic if you are not expecting or handling null inputs to your functions. This repository contains a buggy implementation and a corrected one.
